The Flutter Cat Translator app is a simple application that allows users to convert normal text into cat-like speech. It achieves this by adding cat sounds like "meow" and "brr" to the input text and replacing certain words with cat-related variations. 
 
### Features 
 
1. Text to Cat Translation: The app takes user input in the form of normal text and translates it into cat-like speech by adding cat sounds throughout the text. 
 
2. Word Replacement: The app replaces certain words in the input text with cat-related variations. For example: 
   - "amazing" becomes "meowzing" 
   - "terrific" becomes "prrific" 
 
### Usage 
 
1. Launch the App: Open the Flutter Cat Translator app on your device. 
 
2. Input Text: Enter the desired text into the provided input field. The text can be any sentence or phrase that you want to translate into cat-like speech. 
 
3. Translate Text: Tap the "Encode" button to convert the input text into cat-like speech. The app will add cat sounds like "meow" and "brr" throughout the text and replace certain words with cat-related variations. 
 
4. View Translated Text: The translated text will be displayed in the output area of the app. You can now see the original text transformed into cat-like speech. 
 
5. Clear and Retry: To translate a new text, simply clear the input field and enter a new text. Then tap the "Encode" button again to see the updated translation. 
 
### Example 
 
Input: "This app is amazing and the features are terrific." 
 
Output: "This app is meowzing and the features are prrific." 
 
### Note 
 
The Flutter Cat Translator app is designed for entertainment purposes and to add a touch of fun to your text. The translations are not meant to be accurate or reflect actual cat language.
